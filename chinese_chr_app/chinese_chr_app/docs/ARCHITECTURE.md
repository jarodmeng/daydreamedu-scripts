# ARCHITECTURE — Technical Specs and System Flow

This document describes the current technical implementation. For product strategy see [VISION.md](VISION.md). For release history see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). For full database schema and scripts see [backend/DATABASE.md](../backend/DATABASE.md).

---

## 1. System Overview

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), deployed to Netlify. Routes: Search (`/`), Radicals, Stroke counts, Pinyin results (`/pinyin/:query`), Pinyin Recall game (`/games/pinyin-recall`), Profile and profile-by-category.
- **Backend:** Flask API on port **5001** (to avoid conflict with macOS AirPlay on 5000). Deployed to Google Cloud Run.
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (Google login). Bearer token required for profile and pinyin-recall APIs; optional for search/radicals/stroke-counts.
- **Data:** Character and dictionary data are served from Supabase/Postgres (`DATABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_DB_URL`, DB-only runtime). Images: local `data/png` or Google Cloud Storage bucket `chinese-chr-app-images`.

---

## 2. Project Structure

Paths are relative to the repo root. The app lives under `chinese_chr_app/chinese_chr_app/`.

- **`backend/`** — Flask app (`app.py`), auth (`auth.py`), database layer (`database.py`), pinyin recall logic (`pinyin_recall.py`), pinyin search parsing (`pinyin_search.py`). Scripts under `backend/scripts/` by domain: `characters/`, `pinyin_recall/`, `radicals/`, `utils/`. Schema and scripts are documented in [backend/DATABASE.md](../backend/DATABASE.md).
- **`frontend/`** — Vite + React. Pages under `src/pages/` (Search, PinyinResults, Radicals, RadicalDetail, StrokeCounts, StrokeCountDetail, Profile, ProfileCategory, PinyinRecall). Shared: `App.jsx`, `NavBar.jsx`, `AuthContext.jsx`, `supabaseClient.js`. E2E under `e2e/`.
- **`data/`** — JSON: `characters.json` (Feng 3000), `extracted_characters_hwxnet.json` (HWXNet ~3664), `level-1/2/3.json` (Zibiao-style lists), `radical_stroke_counts.json`. Optional local PNGs under `data/png/`.

---

## 3. Data Model (high-level)

- **Feng (3000 characters):** Primary curriculum set with card images and editable metadata (拼音, 部首, 笔画, 例句, 词组, 结构). Stored in Supabase table `feng_characters`.
- **HWXNet (~3664 characters):** Dictionary source for display, radicals, stroke-counts, and pinyin search. Union of Feng and level-1 commonly used characters. Stored in Supabase table `hwxnet_characters`. Includes `searchable_pinyin` for pinyin search.
- **Stroke order:** Fetched on demand from HanziWriter-compatible CDN; backend proxies and may cache under `data/temp/hanzi_writer/`.
- **Radical stroke counts:** Used to sort the Radicals page by 按部首笔画. Stored in Supabase table `radical_stroke_counts`.

Full schema, indexes, and creation/backfill scripts are in [backend/DATABASE.md](../backend/DATABASE.md).

---

## 4. Search Behavior

- **Input:** One Chinese character or one pinyin syllable (e.g. `ke`, `wo3`). Single CJK character → character search; otherwise → pinyin search.
- **Character search:** If the character is in the Feng set, the Search page shows four panels: 笔顺动画, 字典信息（hwxnet）, 字卡, 字符信息（冯氏早教识字卡）. If the character is only in HWXNet (dictionary-only), the page shows 笔顺动画 and 字典信息 only. Metadata for Feng entries is editable.
- **Pinyin search:** Results page at `/pinyin/:query` lists characters matching that reading, ranked by stroke count (ascending). Clicking a result opens the character detail (Search) view.

---

## 5. API Endpoints

All under `/api/`. Base URL in development: `http://localhost:5001`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|

## 6. Auth

- **Production:** Supabase Auth (Google login). Frontend sends Bearer JWT; backend verifies it against Supabase JWKS (`SUPABASE_URL`). UI treats `useAuth().user` as the authenticated state (Profile and Pinyin Recall show login prompts when `!user`).
- **Dev/E2E:** Backend accepts an optional dev user when `PINYIN_RECALL_DEV_USER` is set (real JWT takes precedence). Frontend can use E2E bypass (`VITE_E2E_AUTH_BYPASS=1` or `?e2e_auth=1`); when bypass is active, the fake session is authoritative (Supabase `onAuthStateChange` is not subscribed). `?e2e_guest=1` forces unauthenticated UI for guest tests.
- **Stricter route:** `POST /api/log-character-view` requires a real JWT only (no dev fallback); other auth-gated routes accept real user or dev user.
- Full flows, env matrix, and troubleshooting: [AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md).

---

## 7. Database (Supabase / Postgres)

The backend runtime is DB-only and requires `DATABASE_URL` (or `SUPABASE_DB_URL`):

- Character and dictionary data are read/written from Supabase tables `feng_characters` and `hwxnet_characters`.
- Signed-in users’ character views (Search) are logged to `character_views`.
- Pinyin recall state and events use `pinyin_recall_character_bank`, `pinyin_recall_item_presented`, `pinyin_recall_item_answered`, and `pinyin_recall_report_error`. Radical stroke counts are served from table `radical_stroke_counts`.

Schema, configuration, data-access layer, and all migration/backfill scripts are documented in [backend/DATABASE.md](../backend/DATABASE.md).

---

## 8. Pinyin Recall (learning game)

### 8.1 Session and queue

- **Session:** User gets a first batch of 20 items from `GET /api/games/pinyin-recall/session`. After finishing a batch, `POST /api/games/pinyin-recall/next-batch` returns the next 20. Session is open-ended until the user ends it.
- **Batch size:** 20 items per batch. `new_count` cap per batch is 8 (at most 8 新字 per batch).
- **Queue construction:** Active Load = count(难字) + count(普通在学字). Three modes:
  - **Expansion** (Active Load < 100): 10 新字 + 10 review.
  - **Consolidation** (100 ≤ Active Load ≤ 250): 5 新字 + 15 review.
  - **Rescue** (Active Load > 250): 4 掌握字 + 8 普通已学字 + 6 在学字 (难字 first) + 2 新字; within 在学字 slots, 难字 first (score ascending), no cap.
- **Slot reservation:** Up to 4 slots per batch are reserved for 巩固 (已学字, score ≥ 10); the rest are filled with 重测 (score < 10) and 新字.

### 8.2 Score and categories

- **Score range:** −50 to 100. Correct: +10 (cap 100). Wrong or 我不知道: −10 (floor −50).
- **Proficiency threshold:** score ≥ 10 = 已学字 (learned). Used for profile 汉字掌握度 and for 巩固 vs 重测.
- **Five bands (for queue selection):** 难字 (score ≤ −20), 普通在学字 (−20 < score ≤ 0), 普通已学字 (0 < score < 20), 掌握字 (score ≥ 20). 未学字 = not yet in bank.
- **Display categories (three):** 新字 (first time), 重测 (retest / still learning), 巩固 (consolidation / maintenance).

### 8.3 Cooling (next_due_utc)

After a correct answer, `next_due_utc` is set by band:

- 难字: 0 days  
- 普通在学字: 1 day  
- 普通已学字: 5 days  
- 掌握字: 22 days  

Only due items (and new items within cap) are eligible for the next batch.

### 8.4 Prompt and distractors

- **Prompt:** Hanzi → pinyin-with-tone (MCQ). Stem shows the character and 1–3 example words/phrases (from Feng words or HWXNet 例词). 我不知道 is always offered.
- **Distractors:** Same syllable different tone, same tone different syllable, tone confusions; polyphonic characters use first pinyin as correct and exclude other readings from distractors.
- **Logging:** Events are written to `pinyin_recall_item_presented` (with `batch_id`, `batch_mode`, `batch_character_category`) and `pinyin_recall_item_answered` (with `score_before`, `score_after`, `category`).

### 8.5 Feedback and review UI

- **Correct-answer screen:** Character, all pinyin (primary in bold), English meaning (英文翻译) when available, 基本解释 when available, stem words.
- **Wrong-answer / 我不知道 screen:** 答错了 (and 你选了: …), correct character and pinyin, then a learning block: English meaning and 基本解释 when available (same two blocks as correct screen), plus 部首/笔画, 结构, 常见词组, 例句 when present in `missed_item`.
- **Final review (复习这些字):** For each missed character, same content as wrong-answer learning block: character, pinyin, Meaning + 基本解释 when available, stem words.

---

## 9. Stroke Animation (HanziWriter)

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/strokes?char=<character>` proxies stroke-order JSON from jsDelivr/unpkg (hanzi-writer-data). Backend may cache under `data/temp/hanzi_writer/`.
- **SSL:** Backend uses the `certifi` CA bundle. To disable SSL verification for CDN fetches (e.g. dev/CI): `HW_STROKES_VERIFY_SSL=0` when starting the backend.

---

## 10. Frontend Routes and Navigation

- **Routes:** `/` (Search), `/radicals`, `/radicals/:radical`, `/stroke-counts`, `/stroke-counts/:count`, `/pinyin/:query`, `/games/pinyin-recall`, `/profile`, `/profile/category/:category`. Unknown paths redirect to `/`.
- **Nav bar:** Search (link to `/`), 分类 dropdown (部首, 笔画), 游戏 dropdown (拼音记忆). Active tab is indicated by style (e.g. Search or 分类 when on a segmentation page).

---

## 11. Testing (E2E)

Playwright tests under `frontend/e2e/` cover:

- **Core:** Character search (4-panel and dictionary-only), radicals list/detail, click-through to search.
- **Pinyin search:** Redirect on pinyin input, results page, no match / invalid format, placeholder.
- **Routing:** Unknown path → home; direct URLs to radical and stroke-count detail.
- **Navigation:** Logo, search link, 分类 and 游戏 dropdowns.
- **Profile:** Unauthenticated → login prompt and return link.
- **Pinyin Recall:** Unauthenticated → login prompt.

Run from `frontend/`: `npm run test:e2e`. Backend should be on port 5001 (or Playwright will try to start it).
